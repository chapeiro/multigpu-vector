DEPRECATED. Experimenting with operator/vector-at-a-time GPU execution

This project has been abandonded, as the development continuous inside
Proteus JIT database engine where we shifted to code generating custom
operators for each device. You can find more details for Proteus design
for GPU-accelerated query execution here: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3316443
